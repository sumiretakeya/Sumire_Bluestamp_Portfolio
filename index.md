<!--- For my second milestone, I trained my machine learning model from my collected data from two exercises on Edge Impulse, an embedded machine learning operations platform, and was able to get an accuracy of 96.64%, which I then proceeded to deploy into an Arduino zip library.Â  (An automatically generated neural network with the best settings for the model)

I then made a new project in Firebase, an app development platform, to create a hosting site between the user interface and the Arduino bluetooth connection. I initialized the newly created project by running the command, "firebase init".

Additionally, I uploaded the original source code of the model library, to understand how the user interface establishes a Bluetooth Low Energy connection with the Arduino and works like a counter.

I worked with the original source code and library, which I knew would upload without external errors, before uploading my own code and library into the Arduino Nano, (Reason Here).

After uploading both the original source code and library zip file to the IDE, I uploaded it to the Arduino Nano.

I added the Firebase configuration to the script.js file of the original source file.

I then opened the website created through Firebase and enabled "Experimental Web Platform Features" by going to "chrome://flags" to access Bluetooth using Chrome.

When accessing the webpage "https://mlfitnesstracker.web.app", which I created through Firebase, the user interface worked seamlessly, as I was able to successfully connect the Arduino Nano with a Bluetooth connection (the feature), and the counter of exercises worked, meaning that if one holding the Arduino Nano were to do one arm circle, the counter on the user interface would display an additional arm circle.

For my next milestone, I will use my own code and library from my machine learning model to set up the user interface and exercise counter. -->

My project is the machine-learning fitness tracker, a device one attaches to their arm that is powered by an Arduino through BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) connection that detects different exercises (Ex: jumping jacks, squats, etc.) and ultimately records the number of repetitions on a user interface. 
For my first milestone, I first set up the Arduino (a microcontroller) by connecting it to Edge Impulse, a platform that uses embedded machine learning. I got the Arduino to be recognized by running the command "edge-impulse-daemon" on the terminal. 

To collect data in a similar manner to the actual armband, I made a prototype case by gluing cardboard pieces together. 
For the placement of the armband, I placed it in the middle of the lower part of the arm to accurately record the movements of the exercises. 
I collected data on two exercises: arm circles and lateral rises. I recorded the exercises on the Arduino at 30 second intervals. I repeated this four times for a total of 2 minutes of data per exercise then went around collecting data from two other people besides myself.
A challenge that I faced was finding a way to take accurate data with the armband, as I initially attached the armband too loosely on the upper part of the arm, which caused the Arduino unable to detect accurate movement. To solve this, I attached the armband on the middle of the lower part of the arm. 

Another challenge that I faced was initially only recording data from myself, which resulted in the model having a 100% accuracy, which meant that it was overtrained with my movements, and would not be able to detect the same exercise if another person were to try it. To solve this, I collected data from more people. 

For the next milestone, I will train the machine learning model on Edge Impulse and test it until I get good accuracy.

<!--- # Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
